                    An extremely skilled pirate who was almost consumed by his own ambition. His slow, yet not too late, realization
                    that friendship and relations matter more than materialistic pirate booty was a result of an adventurous and tumultous life
                    that saw him engage with swashbucklers, assassins, templars, otherworldy artefacts and the notorious East India Company.
                    But, also part of his fascinating story were heartwarming friendships, light moments and melancholy goodbyes.
                    Ultimately, Edward had an epiphany which lead him to abandon his dangerous life and settle with his daughter peacefully
                    whose mother he had abandoned in an insatiable desire "to make it big".

                    His is one of the most engaging and enchanting stories. From the abstract philosophy of the relativity of
                    different evils and the difficult choices one must make to slaying monsters, monstrous in spirit
                    yet only sometimes in shape, making strong bonds with all kinds of beings, visiting fantasical lands,
                    from the beautiful Beauclair to despairing Velen, and of course making memories all along the way.
                    Hearing of his adventures one is uncontrollably attached to its people invloved and lands ventured upon.
                    Truly makes one visit another reality.
